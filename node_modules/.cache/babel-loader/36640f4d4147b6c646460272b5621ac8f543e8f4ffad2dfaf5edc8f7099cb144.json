Jack Smith, an American attorney currently serving as the Special Counsel for the United States Department of Justice, was appointed by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland to lead independent investigations into Trump's actions.\r\n            <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/judge-rejects-trump-immunity-claim-federal-2020-election-case-2023-12-02/\" target='_blank'><span>(Reported by Reuters)</span></a>\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"info\">Trump's claim of presidential immunity suffered a blow as the Federal appeals court denied it, preventing him from defending his cases.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"info\">Palmer Report's response, crafted by Bill Palmer, reflected a celebratory tone, characterizing Trump's reaction as a \"meltdown\" and labelling it \"incoherently bizarre.\" The article taunted Trump's grammatical errors in his social media posts without providing specific citations or graphics as supporting evidence.</p>\r\n          \r\n            <p className=\"info\">Furthermore, the article suggested, \"Trump doesn’t seem to be taking the news well, as he was barely able to speak.\" The source for this information is attributed to another article on the same website, which, upon inspection, lacked concrete evidence to support such a claim.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"info\">Zhong argued that the article’s evidence leans aggressively towards the liberal viewpoint, as quoted “Jack Smith has won the day,” implying a broader success for the liberal party with the denial of their political opponent's claim.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"info\">Another piece of text evidence drawing criticism was, \"Trump can’t drag out his appeals endlessly.\" The choice of wording evoked strong emotions, insinuating that Trump was intentionally prolonging his appeal due to guilt. However, it is essential to note that no court conclusions had been reached as of the article's publication date.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"info\">Zhong argued that the evidence presented in the article is poorly balanced and heavily biased, that there was a “lack of variety in the evidence,” and that the proofs were “not sufficient for supporting the arguments.” He determined that the type of evidence used was ineffective and untrustworthy.</p>\r\n          \r\n            <p className=\"sub\">Objectivity</p>\r\n            <div className=\"image-container\">            \r\n              <img src={require(\"./images/palmer-social.png\")} alt=\"\" />\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"info\">Zhong also pointed out, \"The article has a lack of supporting evidence on the opposing perspective, which damages the overall quality of the writing.”</p>\r\n            <p className=\"info\">The article,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.palmerreport.com/analysis/donald-trump-has-incoherently-bizarre-truth-social-meltdown-after-jack-smith-gets-the-best-of-him/53568/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Donald Trump has incoherently bizarre Truth Social meltdown after Jack Smith gets the best of him</em></a>, proved Bill Palmer’s bias because he did not subjectively provide the perspectives of both sides of the issue.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"info\">No evidence was included in Bill’s article that represented Trump’s perspective; instead, Bill utilized the lack of information and bashed Donald Trump.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"info\">Bill wrote, “Donald Trump is falling apart in real time.\" Through the subtext, Zhong identified Bill’s attitude towards the issue. Zhong mentioned that Bill used a biased tone to celebrate Trump’s struggle in court, and after “considering potential motives,” Zhong concluded that Bill’s overall objective is to target and put shame on the Democratic Party's political opponent.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"info\">Overall, Zhong concluded that Palmer Report is not a trustworth source base on its lack of reliablilty, imbalance in supporting evidence, as well as pushing a blatantly biassed agenda. He warned citizens to watch out for these fake news source and do more research before making a decision to believe in a news article online.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n        </article>\r\n\r\n        <footer>\r\n          <p>&copy; 2023 RHHS Fake News Outlet Outlet.
