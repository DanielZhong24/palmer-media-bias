Jack Smith, an American attorney currently serving as the Special Counsel for the United States Department of Justice, was appointed by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland to lead independent investigations into Trump's actions.\r\n            <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/judge-rejects-trump-immunity-claim-federal-2020-election-case-2023-12-02/\" target='_blank'><span>(Reported by Reuters)</span></a>\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"info\">Trump's claim of presidential immunity suffered a blow as the Federal appeals court denied it, preventing him from defending his cases.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"info\">Palmer Report's response, crafted by Bill Palmer, reflects a celebratory tone, characterizing Trump's reaction as a \"meltdown\" and labelling it \"incoherently bizarre.\" The article taunts Trump's grammatical errors in his social media posts without providing specific citations or graphics as supporting evidence.</p>\r\n          \r\n            <p className=\"info\">Furthermore, the article suggests, \"Trump doesn’t seem to be taking the news well, as he was barely able to speak.\" The source for this information is attributed to another article on the same website, which, upon inspection, lacks concrete evidence to support such a claim.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"info\">Zhong argued that the article’s evidence leans aggressively towards the liberal viewpoint, as quoted in “Jack Smith has won the day,” implying a broader success for the liberal party with the denial of their political opponent's claim.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"info\">Another piece of text evidence drawing criticism is, \"Trump can’t drag out his appeals endlessly.\" This choice of wording evokes strong emotions, insinuating that Trump is intentionally prolonging his appeal due to guilt. However, it is essential to note that no court conclusions had been reached as of the article's publication date.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"info\">Zhong argues that the evidence presented in the article is poorly balanced and heavily biased, that there is a “lack of variety in the evidence,” and that the proofs are “not sufficient for supporting the arguments.” He thinks that the type of evidence used was ineffective and untrustworthy.</p>\r\n          \r\n            <p className=\"sub\">Objectivity</p>\r\n            <p className=\"info\">Zhong also points out, \"The article also has a lack of supporting evidence on the opposing perspective, which damages the overall quality of the writing.”</p>\r\n            <p className=\"info\">The article, Donald Trump's incoherently bizarre Truth Social meltdown after Jack, proved Bill Palmer’s bias because he did not subjectively provide the perspectives of both sides of the issue.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"info\">No evidence was included in Bill’s article that represented Trump’s perspective; instead, Bill utilized the lack of information and bashed Donald Trump.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"info\">Bill wrote, “Donald Trump is falling apart in real time.\" Through the subtext, Zhong identified Bill’s attitude towards the issue. Zhong mentioned that Bill used a biased tone to celebrate Trump’s struggle in court, and after “considering potential motives,” Zhong concluded that Bill’s overall objective is to target and put shame on the Democratic Party's political opponent.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n        </article>\r\n\r\n        <footer>\r\n          <p>&copy; 2023 RHHS Fake News Outlet Outlet.
